<h3>Product Genius</h3>
 A full stack web application built in Python with Flask. [Product Genius](https://productgenius.herokuapp.com/) enables consumers to make data-driven decisions about products. Most online shopping sites display a product's average rating, which can be misleading for products with few reviews. PG implements its own rating system, using Bayesian averaging, to present a more robust metric to the consumer. PG also aggregates useful information from customer reviews, using machine learning to extract the most relevant terms from positive and negative reviews of a product. Code available on [GitHub](https://github.com/michberr/ProductGenius). 

***Tools**: Python, Flask, PostgreSQL, SQLAlchemy, NumPy, Scikit-Learn, HTML, CSS, Javascript, jQuery, Chart.js, Bootstrap, Jinja2*

<h3>Inferring microbial species from genome sequencing</h3>
A critical perspective piece on the Oligotyping method, which is gaining popularity in genomic studies of microbial populations to provide higher resolution of species units. We summarize how this method has been used in the disciplinary literature and examine the validity of several ecological claims. 
Paper published in [Frontiers in Microbiology](http://journal.frontiersin.org/article/10.3389/fmicb.2017.00365/full). Code available on [GitHub](https://github.com/DenefLab/microcystis-oligotypes).
     
***Tools**: R, Oligotyping, Unix*

<h3>Lake Erie Harmful Algal Blooms</h3>
An ecological analysis of microbial community population dynamics during a major Cyanobacterial harmful algal bloom in Lake Erie that led to water shutdowns for 500,000 people in Toledo Ohio. Paper published in [Environmental Microbiology](http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/1462-2920.13640/abstract?campaign=wolacceptedarticle). Code available on [GitHub](https://github.com/DenefLab/chab-microbial-ecology).

***Analytics**: Multidimensional scaling, time series analysis, linear regression, model selection, bootstrapping*
